VThe Space Operations unit of the Lockheed Martin Corporation's said yesterday that it planned to cut costs by assuming all work on an annual $500 million space shuttle contract that it now splits with three other companies. The Lockheed Martin unit had contracted some work at the Kennedy Space Center to a unit of the Northrop Grumman Corporation, to the Thiokol Corporation and to a unit of Johnson Controls Inc. Lockheed Martin's contracts with the companies end in September. Thiokol, based in Ogden, Utah, said losing its share of the contract would cost about $30 million a year. Most of the Grumman and Thiokol workers are expected to apply to Lockheed Martin to continue in the same jobs.

aVFor years, the Lockheed Corporation centered its aircraft manufacturing in Burbank, Calif., where thousands of workers built prosperous lives on wages that reached as high as $20 an hour. That factory is closed now and wildflowers grow through crevices in the concrete that surrounds the shuttered buildings. The new heart of Lockheed's operations beats most strongly today here in Georgia, where the company makes its military planes with lower-cost labor. The nation's manufacturers of military hardware, an industry that still employs nearly 1.5 million people, are migrating. Like Lockheed, they are transferring operations to Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi and other low-cost states. In doing so, they are joining the rest of corporate America in its itinerant search for cheaper wages, fewer unions, less regulation and easier tax policies. And gradually the South and the Rocky Mountains are becoming the new centers for military spending, edging aside the Northeast and the Pacific Coast.

VBy reopening the debate in Congress on the appropriate level of military spending, President Bush's move to reduce the nation's nuclear forces raises the possibility that Pentagon contractors will face deeper and faster cuts in weapons programs than they previously envisioned, analysts said today. In acknowledging in his speech on Friday that the threat from the Soviet Union is considerably diminished, President Bush made it easier for Democrats in Congress to oppose a wide range of weapons programs, analysts and industry executives said. Support for the Northrop Corporation's B-2 Stealth bomber, already waning, eroded further over the weekend, with even staunch supporters like Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, saying the program should be scaled back.

Otherwise, they said, the Government would oppose the deal altogether.

aVThe Lockheed Martin Corporation said today that the Government ''fundamentally opposed'' its planned purchase of the Northrop Grumman Corporation, suggesting that Federal regulators may believe that the consolidation among military suppliers has gone too far to maintain competition. The Defense Department and the Justice Department, which are reviewing the agreement, characterized their positions slightly differently, saying only that they had serious concerns about the deal and were talking with the companies about it. But if the Government tried to block the acquisition, which is possible, it would be a reversal from the Pentagon's recent policy of encouraging such mergers to help cut costs amid the fall in military spending since the end of the cold war.

But there is one question Mr. Jordan seems not yet ready to answer: What will happen to the five businesses that make up Westinghouse's $5.5 billion industries and technology group, whose lackluster performance drove Westinghouse into the media camp in the first place?

VThe Lockheed Martin Corporation said yesterday that it had received a contract potentially worth $1 billion to provide communications and intelligence systems for the Navy's new attack submarine. The company said that its Lockheed Martin Federal Systems subsidiary, based in Manassas, Va., would deliver the first system in November 2000. The submarine is to begin sea trials in 2004. Subcontractors are the Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Raytheon Company. Lockheed said the contract's base period runs to November 2000, with three options for more systems.

aVThe Lockheed Martin Corporation, which was created in a merger last year of the Lockheed Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation, has replaced the McDonnell Douglas Corporation as the largest military contractor, the Pentagon said this week. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., had $10.5 billion in contract awards in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, compared with $8 billion for McDonnell Douglas, which slipped to No. 2 as its contract business fell by $1.3 billion from the previous year.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation said on Friday that it planned to sell seven million shares of stock, using the proceeds to repay debt it took on for its $3 billion purchase of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's defense electronics unit. At Friday's share price of about $58.125, down 87.5 cents, selling seven million shares would raise $406.9 million before underwriting costs.

aVTHE boss, whip-smart and self-assured, had risen like a comet to become chief executive of a blue-chip entertainment company in his early 40's. On the way up, however, he had acquired certain blind spots. He was an armchair quarterback, signing off on every small decision. His meetings were a disaster: people wandered in every few minutes, with the boss doing nothing to fend off distractions. Key vice presidents were on the verge of mass resignation. The directors got wind of the crisis. A call went out to Howard J. Morgan, a human resources consultant who calls himself an executive coach -- a Mr. Fix-It for personal dysfunction in the executive suite.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation yesterday reported an 8.9 percent increase in earnings for the second quarter, reflecting the March acquisition of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's military electronics businesses. For the quarter, the company earned $86 million, or $1.69 a share, compared with $79 million, or $1.59 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results easily exceed Wall Street estimates of $1.20 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation said it had sold seven million common shares at $63.25 each, raising $422.75 million. The military contractor, based in Los Angeles, said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt incurred from its $3 billion acquisition of the military and electronics business of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which it completed March 1. The shares were offered simultaneously to United States and foreign investors. The company said it had set aside another 1.05 million shares for unexpected demand. Northrop shares rose $2.50 yesterday, to $65.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

VIn a further step to sharpen its business focus as well as to reduce debt incurred in its $5.4 billion acquisition of CBS Inc., the Westinghouse Electric Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its military and electronics systems businesses to the Northrop Grumman Corporation for $3 billion in cash. The announcement closely follows Westinghouse's sale on Dec. 21 of the Knoll Group, its office-furnishings unit, to Warburg Pincus Ventures L.P. for $565 million. Proceeds from the two sales will enable the company to repay more than 65 percent of the debt incurred from the purchase of CBS.

aVIn a startling move that accelerates the consolidation of military contractors and is likely to lead to more layoffs, the Lockheed Martin Corporation announced today that it planned to acquire most of the Loral Corporation in a complex deal that is valued at more than $10 billion. The announcement came as a surprise, in large part because Lockheed Martin was itself a result of a merger, in 1994, and it is still struggling to digest that combination. But the announcement underscored pressure from the markets -- and from the Pentagon -- for military contractors to grow larger and more efficient through consolidation to survive at a time of declining military procurement budgets.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation said yesterday that it would dismiss 2,100 people from its military aircraft division in Southern California by the end of the year. Northrop Grumman, the military contractor, employs about 12,500 people in the region. It said declining work on its two major aircraft programs, the B-2 Stealth bomber and the F/A-18 attack fighter, made the cuts necessary. The planned reductions also arise from cost cuts on the version of the F/A-18 that is now in production. Northrop Grumman, which is based in Los Angeles, said that most of the cuts would be made by July 1.

aVThe United States economy gained strength last month even though a midwinter lull in aircraft purchases caused factory orders to fall by the largest percentage in 10 months, the Commerce Department reported today. While overall orders dropped 2.5 percent in February -- as demand for passenger jets weakened -- analysts pointed to a seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in orders excluding transportation equipment as a sign that a spring rebound for the economy was likely.

VCOMING: A COMPACT FORD -- Ford Motor Company reported losing $12.7 billion last year, making 2006 the worst year in its history. Now the bigger-is-better world view that has defined the automaker for decades is being replaced by its new chief, Alan R. Mulally, with a new approach: less is more. [Page A1.] G.M. FORESEES A PROFIT -- General Motors said that it expected to post a profit for the fourth quarter but that it would delay reporting the results because its finance arm needs more time to complete calculations. [C7.] TROUBLE WITH ANEMIA DRUG -- Amgen, the biotechnology company, said that its anemia drug Aranesp increased the risk of death when used to treat certain cancer patients, a finding that will probably raise more questions about it and very similar drugs. [C3.] MICROSOFT REPORTS SALES -- Microsoft reported strong sales for its latest quarter and a profit that slightly surpassed Wall Street estimates, but its financial results were muddled by the late arrival of important new products. [C1.] 12 PERCENT ARE UNION WORKERS -- Union membership dropped sharply last year in the United States, falling by 326,000 to 15.4 million workers. The percentage of employees in unions is now 12 percent, down from 35 percent in the 1950s. [A17.] PROTEST FOLLOWS RAID -- An immigration raid at a huge North Carolina pork-packing plant provoked protests from union officials, who charged that the company, Smithfield Foods, had collaborated with the authorities searching for illegal immigrants to discourage its workers from organizing. [A17.] CANADIAN MAKES AN ENTRANCE -- The Power Corporation of Canada, one of the country's largest financial services companies and Quebec's pre-eminent newspaper publisher, is relatively unknown in the United States. That may change soon as Power, led by its patriarch Paul Desmarais, left, is negotiating to acquire Marsh & McLennan's Putnam Investments Mutual Fund unit. [C6.] LETTER OF APOLOGY -- Just a few weeks after alarming parents about the safety of infant car seats in automobile crashes, Consumer Reports sent letters to its readers retracting the results and apologizing for botching the test. [A16.] A CABLE ANCHOR'S CONDUCT -- The CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo, who flew home from China aboard Citigroup's corporate jet late last year, is facing questions over her judgment in getting too close to the people she covers. [C1.] WAL-MART SETTLES OVERTIME SUIT -- The Department of Labor announced that Wal-Mart Stores had agreed to pay $33.5 million in back wages plus interest to settle a federal lawsuit that accused the company of violating overtime laws. [C7.] SUBPRIME MARKET SLUMPS -- Wall Street firms, stung by rising default rates, have begun to tighten the spigot of money that has fueled the market for home loans to people with weak credit, or subprime mortgages. [C1.] NO RED CARPET -- The founder of the annual economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, has asked Hollywood celebrities to stay home this year, as a means to restore the event's seriousness. [C1.] HIGHER EARNINGS AT DOW JONES -- Dow Jones & Company reported sharply higher fourth-quarter earnings on special gains from the sale of several newspapers, an acquisition and stronger advertising sales at The Wall Street Journal. [C2.] A FAST-MOVING ECONOMY -- The latest figures from China show that its economy grew by a whopping 10.7 percent in 2006, the fastest pace in more than a decade, with only modest signs of inflation. [C3.] AT&T PROFIT UP 17 PERCENT -- AT&T reported a 17 percent increase in quarterly profits driven by a sizable increase in wireless subscribers. The report capped a whirlwind year of merging and rebranding that has come to characterize the telecommunications business. [C8.] IT'S A BARGAIN -- Commercials during the coming Super Bowl will cost an average of $2.6 million for each 30-second spot, a record amount. But more than two dozen marketers believe it makes sense to spend that much money compared with the many cheaper alternatives. Advertising: Stuart Elliot. [C2.] ARREST OF EX-MEDIA OFFICIAL -- Federal authorities have arrested a former treasurer of the media conglomerate NBC Universal on charges of stealing more than $800,000 to finance private jet flights, liquor and a vacation home. [C4.] RESHUFFLE AT EMI'S U.S. UNIT -- EMI Group, the British music conglomerate, reorganized its American unit by merging the operations of its two main record labels. [C3.] Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. Two military contractors, the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Northrop Grumman Company, posted higher fourth-quarter earnings as government spending in areas like military hardware and information and technology remained strong. (AP) Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 30 percent, as strong sales of health care and personal products offset higher prices for raw materials. (AP) Shareholders of ICOS approved a $2.3 billion buyout offer from Eli Lilly, a deal that would combine the companies behind the impotence drug Cialis. (AP)

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that short interest rose 5.8 percent, or 9.3 million shares, in the month ended Sept. 15, to a record 168.7 million shares. The previous high of 166.2 million shares was set on July 15. The short interest for the period a year earlier totaled 120.1 million shares. In the latest period, the short interest on the American Stock Exchange fell 410,078 shares, to 15.1 million shares. A short position can result from the sale of borrowed stock in the hope of buying the same issue at a later date and at a lower price to cover the sale.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short by investors and not yet covered increased by 4.9 million shares, or slightly less than six-tenths of 1 percent, for the month ended Dec. 14. The new level is a record, but the increase was far smaller than the rise of 62.6 million shares, or 7.9 percent, for the month ended Nov. 15. The Big Board said that as of the December settlement date, 855.7 million shares were held in a short position, compared with an adjusted total of 850.8 million shares, the previous record level, on Nov. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Amex Short Sales Decline Also for the period ended Dec. 14, the American Stock Exchange said the number of shares sold short declined by 306,409, to 83.2 million shares. That figure represented a decline of less than four-tenths of 1 percent from its record level at the Nov. 15 reporting period. The Nov. 15 total was adjusted to 83.5 million shares. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since the seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought back at a lower price. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers and represents the "short interest" for that period. Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. Value of Figure as an Indicator Is Questioned The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short-interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-year tax strategies.

VThe General Dynamics Corporation extended its $2.6 billion offer for Newport News Shipbuilding, the military contractor, for a sixth time because federal regulators need more time to review the proposal. The $67.50-a-share offer for Newport News, the only maker of nuclear aircraft carriers in the nation, expired Friday. About 22.5 million, or 76 percent of Newport News's shares have been tendered, General Dynamics said. The new offer expires Sept. 14. General Dynamics and the Northrop Grumman Corporation are competing to acquire Newport News. Northrop Grumman, which is based in Los Angeles, extended its offer Thursday, to Sept. 13.

aVAcross corporate America yesterday, senior managers and executives grappled with trying to restore at least a semblance of business as usual -- even though they knew that, emotionally at least, it was anything but.

aVFor a nation that became enamored of the stock market over the last decade, investing seemed a trivial, even forgotten pursuit, over the last week. Yet as the market prepared to reopen after a strike to the heart of Wall Street, investors faced an unavoidable question: What should I do now? Precedents are of limited value. Bullish advice may be dusted with patriotism, bearishness exaggerated by fear. So many professional investors and money managers are retreating to the most basic kind of guidance: Hold tight.

Just a few blocks away from the New York Stock Exchange, workers continued to dig remains out of a mountain of rubble. [Page C1.]

VThe General Dynamics Corporation and its rival military contractor, the Northrop Grumman Corporation, said yesterday that they had agreed to delay closing their competing bids for Newport News Shipbuilding to allow regulators more time to review the offers. The companies said they had signed an agreement with the Departments of Justice and Defense agreeing not to seek a final decision on their offers before Aug. 20. The agreement means the winning bidder will not be able to close the transaction until Sept. 4 at the earliest, General Dynamics said.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation is suing the Lockheed Martin Corporation over accusations that Lockheed cut it out of a $4 billion Army contract, escalating a fight among various companies over the shrinking number of military contracts. Northrop's lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in San Jose in December, states that after Northrop helped Lockheed secure a contract to manufacture a new missile defense system, Lockheed assigned Northrop's share of the job to one of its own production units.

VThe military contractor the Northrop Grumman Corporation said it had begun its offer for shares of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., despite Newport's planned merger with a Northrop rival, the General Dynamics Corporation. Northrop said it would pay shareholders of Newport News $67.50 in cash or the equivalent in Northrop stock for each Newport News share, and that it was willing to negotiate the terms if Newport News would let Northrop review its financial records. A spokeswoman for Newport News, which makes ships for the Navy, said its board would review the offer. Northrop's bid matches an offer from General Dynamics, which had planned to acquire Newport News in a mutually negotiated $2.1 billion deal, announced in April. Newport News last week told shareholders that it would stick with the General Dynamics deal while waiting for details on Northrop's proposal.

aVThe Northrop Grumman Corporation made an unsolicited bid yesterday to buy Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., an effort intended to undercut a deal struck last month between Newport News and the General Dynamics Corporation. Northrop's offer, which was summarized in a letter from Kent Kresa, the company's chairman and chief executive, to William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive of Newport News, is for $2.1 billion, or $67.50 a share, the same price General Dynamics has offered.

aVEXECUTIVES from the Northrop Grumman Corporation began explaining and defending the company's hostile $2.1 billion bid for Newport News Shipbuilding yesterday. But as of the close of business, the company had yet to make details of the offer available to the company it intends to wrest away from the General Dynamics Corporation, which agreed last month to buy Newport News for the same price in cash. Early yesterday, Newport News said its board would meet to consider Northrop's offer once specifics, like the exchange ratio of the common stock portion of the offer, were provided. As outlined late Tuesday, Northrop Grumman said it would pay 25 percent of the $67.50-a-share price for Newport News in cash and the remaining 75 percent in stock. It would also assume $500 million in debt. If Newport News were ultimately to accept the Northrop bid, it would have to pay General Dynamics a $50 million breakup fee.

aVAntitrust enforcers at the Justice Department are taking a closer look at the General Dynamics Corporation's proposed acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding. General Dynamics said it had received a request from the department for information about the proposed deal, a sign that it intends to scrutinize its competitive impact closely. Newport News is the subject of rival bids from General Dynamics and the Northrop Grumman Corporation. Northrop has argued that the General Dynamics proposal would create a monopoly in nuclear shipbuilding.

Northrop, based in Los Angeles, said it would pay cash for the unit, which had 2000 revenue of $323 million and specializes in space-borne sensing for early warning systems, smart-weapons technology and ground systems that process data from space-based platforms. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, was expected to close during the summer, the company said.

General Dynamics, which is battling a rival, the Northrop Grumman Corporation, to take over Newport News, extended its offer to Aug. 3. It had been scheduled to expire on July 20. About 21.2 million Newport News shares had been tendered to General Dynamics as of July 20, far exceeding the majority of shares outstanding, the company said. Last week Northrop extended its offer for Newport News to Aug. 2 and said about 2.26 million shares had been tendered. The acquisition proposals from General Dynamics and Northrop are under regulatory review by the Justice and Defense Departments.

The contracts by the Department of Health and Human Services are meant to accelerate the use of modern computer technology in health care. The contracts totaling $18.6 million are a fraction of the investment that the four groups -- led by Accenture, the Computer Sciences Corporation, I.B.M. and Northrop Grumman -- will invest in the regions.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation announced an unsolicited $5.9 billion stock offer today for the TRW Corporation in the hope of becoming the nation's leading satellite and missile contractor as military spending rises in response to terrorist threats. Northrop's chairman, Kent Kresa, sent a letter on Thursday to Philip A. Odeen, TRW's nonexecutive chairman, and Kenneth W. Freeman, a board member, offering shareholders $47 in Northrop common stock for each share of TRW, an 18 percent premium based on TRW's closing price of $39.80 on Thursday. Northrop would also assume about $5.5 billion in debt.
p313
aVThis was not how Philip A. Odeen expected 2002 to go. He had spent more than 40 years working his way up management ladders in government and the private sector. At 66 and newly retired as executive vice president for Washington operations for the TRW Corporation, he was ready for a new phase. He would still consult for TRW and the government, and he would still fulfill his duties as a director of four companies.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation, the military contractor, detailed two proposals today that it plans to take to a shareholder meeting of TRW Inc. in April urging TRW's board to reconsider its $5.9 billion takeover offer. The proposals call for TRW to set up a committee of independent directors to consider Northrop's $47-a-share unsolicited bid and to give Northrop access to crucial financial information.

aVTRW Inc. advised shareholders yesterday to reject two proposals made by the Northrop Grumman Corporation, which has made a $6 billion takeover bid for TRW. The proposals, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week, call on TRW's board to provide Northrop with nonpublic financial information and to establish a committee of independent directors to review Northrop's $47-a-share takeover bid. The bid is more than $4 a share below TRW's current market value. TRW formally rejected Northrop's offer earlier this month, calling it inadequate, and proposed instead to spin off its auto parts unit and sell the TRW Aeronautical Systems Group. TRW is based in Cleveland, and Northrop is based in Los Angeles.

Designed for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, the F-35 will be the last new manned American fighter for decades to come. But, as things turned out, Boeing's warplane operations were set back only momentarily. The company is moving on to the next generation of combat planes: robotic, pilotless aircraft.

The previous deadline of last Friday was extended until this Friday, Northrop said. Northrop filed its stock swap offer for TRW with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, but agreed last month to delay its bid while it examines TRW's private records under a confidentiality agreement.

Aldridge, the undersecretary for acquisition and technology, in an effort to pave the way for a security review, these people said.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation, the nation's third-largest military contractor, agreed to buy TRW Inc. for $7.8 billion in stock yesterday, in a deal that will make Northrop almost as large as the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Boeing Company. The TRW deal, which will give Northrop the power to compete more effectively for new federal contracts for domestic security and space electronics, caps a string of acquisitions for the company, which is based in Los Angeles. Five years ago, antitrust concerns halted a plan by Lockheed to take over Northrop, forcing Northrop to embark on a new strategic direction to grow by takeovers.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation, in the midst of an attempt to buy a rival military contractor, the TRW Corporation, for $6.7 billion, said yesterday that it refused to sign a confidentiality agreement that would have opened TRW's financial records for inspection. Northrop Grumman said the agreement contained restrictions, like a a standstill clause, that it regarded as onerous. Northrop Grumman also encouraged TRW's shareholders to urge the company's directors to consider the bid, which amounts to $53 a share, when TRW holds its annual meeting tomorrow. TRW, which is based in Cleveland, has rejected Northrop Grumman's bid, saying it is too low. Northrop Grumman, which is based in Los Angeles, raised its bid from $5.9 billion a week ago.

TRW said that Northrop Grumman was invited to participate but it did not identify the parties that had signed the confidentiality agreement. Such an agreement gives potential bidders access to confidential financial information. TRW has said the offer from Northrop, based in Los Angeles, is too low. TRW, a military contractor, is based in Cleveland.

aVTRW Inc., which received a higher takeover bid from the Northrop Grumman Corporation, advised its shareholders yesterday not to take any action while it reviewed the proposal. Northrop raised its bid to $6.7 billion from $5.9 billion on Sunday. TRW, a satellite and missile maker based in Cleveland, rejected the earlier bid as inadequate. The new offer is valued at $53 a share, compared with an original bid of $47 a share. Northrop Grumman, a military contractor based in Los Angeles, set a May 3 deadline for the offer to be accepted or rejected.

aVThe Northrop Grumman Corporation said yesterday that it would not appeal a court ruling that allows TRW Inc. to delay a meeting on Northrop's $12.2 billion hostile bid for the company until May 3. The meeting, originally set for Monday, will let shareholders vote on a proposal made by Northrop that would allow it to begin buying TRW shares. Northrop also wants TRW to allow shareholders who are precluded from voting under Ohio law to be given a vote. TRW is scheduled to hold its annual meeting Wednesday in Cleveland, where it is based. Northrop, which is based in Los Angeles, is pursuing TRW to increase sales of military and aerospace electronics.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered in the month ended Nov. 15 increased by 62.6 million, to a record level. The new total is 7.9 percent above the previous record, which was set a month earlier. The Big Board said that as of the November settlement date, a record 850.8 million shares were held in a short position -- sold "short" by investors and not yet covered -- compared with an adjusted total of 788.1 million shares on Oct. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Also for the month ended Nov. 15, the American Stock Exchange reported its short sales outstanding rose by 680,700 million shares, to a record total of 81.7 million, an increase of less than 1 percent above the previous record total reported for the period ended Oct. 15. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since a short-seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought at a lower price. Debate Over Meaning Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the short-interest figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-the-year tax strategies. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange, as well as by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 11/15/90 10/15/90 1838 Bond-Deb Tradng 10,442 0 AAR Corp 86,360 69,250 Abbott Labs* 1,420,148 1,545,892 ACM Govt Income* 238,933 5,370 Acuson Corp* 285,747 182,343 Adams Express* 324,348 313,497 Adobe Resources Corp 29,976 7,766 Advanced Micro Dev* 760,211 615,480 Aetna Life Casualty* 3,198,994 1,546,712 Ahmanson HF* 2,395,585 1,709,527 Air Products Chem* 187,646 151,702 Airborne Freight Cor 98,556 71,820 Alaska Air Group* 412,245 299,046 Albany Int'l Cl A* 125,000 107,200 Alberto Culver Cl B* 233,712 157,867 Albertson's Inc* 515,825 660,298 Alcan Aluminium Ltd.* 9,095,127 394,674 Alexanders Inc* 142,273 104,289 Allegheny Ludlum 87,642 42,949 Allegheny Pwr* 972,243 1,250,818 Allen Group Inc 54,712 68,586 Allergan, Inc.* 169,906 180,900 Alliance Capital Mgt 16,400 0 Alliant Techsystems 40,518 0 Allied-Signal Inc* 306,093 486,409 Allst Mun Inc Opp II 17,400 4,000 Allstate Mun Incm 12,004 1,902 Allstate Muni Prem 25,000 0 AM International* 122,482 134,832 Amdura Corp* 152,433 171,000 Amer Brands* 4,116,297 0 Amer Elec Pwr* 914,440 891,244 Amer Express Co* 3,628,937 3,370,554 Amer Family Corp* 279,296 220,328 Amer General* 215,013 430,810 Amer Health Prop 14,286 34,994 Amer President Co's* 214,856 166,914 Amer Real Estate, LP 1,000 13,600 Amer Savs Bk $1.8125* 202,699 224,299 Amer Stores Co* 130,984 115,452 Amer Tel & Tel* 4,352,238 4,456,819 Amer Waste Svcs Cl A 44,158 12,000 Amerada Hess Corp* 359,219 322,854 American Cyanamid Co* 243,880 306,349 American Intl Group* 1,361,089 1,399,246 American Savings Bk* 597,590 615,439 Ameriscribe Corp* 122,450 147,020 Ameritech* 1,607,976 1,630,808 Ames Dept Stores* 2,362,265 2,725,585 Ametek Inc* 102,922 114,714 Amoco Corp* 1,942,445 2,493,842 AMP Inc* 610,291 542,870 AMR Inc* 1,415,184 1,084,860 AMRE, Inc.* 611,600 649,600 Amsouth Bancorp 20,325 32,097 Anadarko Petroleum* 380,853 839,423 Angelica Corp 22,875 2,162 Anheuser Busch Co* 641,949 622,940 Aon Corp 28,319 4,087 Apache Corp* 354,595 89,375 Archer Daniels* 588,069 714,214 Arctic Alaska Fish* 423,750 324,350 Arkla, Inc* 2,642,224 1,588,771 Armstrong World Ind* 223,194 283,213 Arvin Ind,inc* 344,560 333,529 ASA Limited* 166,497 252,171 Asarco Inc* 103,047 136,337 Ashland Oil* 170,596 237,879 Asia Pacific Fund 27,871 16,171 Asset Invest Corp 37,927 1,365 Associated Natl Gas* 144,388 67,238 Atlantic Energy Inc.* 173,399 192,479 Atlantic Richfield* 1,142,835 1,377,144 Automatic Data Proc* 698,405 821,515 Avery Dennison Corp* 196,576 2,270,631 Avnet Inc 31,000 43,239 Avon Prods $2.00 E-R* 151,900 53,100 Avon Products* 363,667 566,982 Baker Hughes Inc* 1,394,883 1,694,418 Ball Corp 79,947 64,637 Bally Mfg Corp* 8,309,831 7,715,146 Balt Gas & Elec Co* 1,183,998 1,289,928 Baltimore Bancorp* 1,156,550 1,234,200 Banc One Corp* 1,186,119 1,289,911 Banco Cntrl (ADR) 11,664 0 Bandag Inc 82,713 72,025 Bank of Boston Corp* 9,056,380 9,514,488 Bank of New England* 5,851,080 7,919,405 Bank of New York* 928,075 844,749 Bank Tr NY* 1,003,331 944,244 Bankamerica Corp* 2,082,533 1,865,097 Barclays Bank ADR A 12,671 31,249 Barclays Plc (ADR) 300 23,764 Barnett Banks Inc* 2,948,194 1,863,855 Bass Plc (ADR) 26,784 901 Battle Mtn Gold* 260,740 212,850 Bausch & Lomb Inc* 369,423 320,633 Baxter Int'l Cv Exch 15,032 32 Baxter International* 3,643,500 3,850,604 Bear Stearns Co* 976,348 1,400,541 Bearings Inc 46,600 19,550 Beazer Plc (ADR)* 365,250 473,984 Beckman Instruments* 124,669 113,260 Bell Atlantic Corp* 1,850,118 1,405,221 Bellsouth Corp* 1,300,247 1,163,574 Bemis Co Inc 70,732 94,206 Beneficial Corp* 580,145 517,883 Benetton Group (ADR) 56,319 97,300 Berlitz Int'l 16,300 38,145 Bethlehem Steel Corp* 645,703 591,861 Beverly Enterprises* 1,490,130 943,176 Black & Decker Corp* 5,872,918 4,710,697 Blackstone Adv Term 1,677 21,580 Blackstone Incm Trst 71,328 54,932 Blackstone Target Tr 69,477 54,896 Blockbuster Enter* 5,596,785 4,845,133 Blue Chip Value Fund 28,397 12,300 Boeing Company* 1,706,207 2,045,699 Boise Cascade Corp* 555,560 412,131 Borden Chem (units) 21,616 4,788 Borden Inc* 162,985 255,637 Briggs & Stratton* 889,734 798,655 Bristol-Myers Squibb* 4,248,691 4,119,897 British Airways(ADR) 71,770 85,370 British Petrol (ADR)* 651,127 563,305 Broad, Inc. 88,749 37,200 Brooklyn Union Gas 37,564 53,317 Browning Ferris Ind* 836,352 1,314,324 Brunswick Corp* 1,542,915 1,505,678 Brush Wellman Inc 76,800 64,600 Burlington Northern* 264,812 290,104 Burnham Pacif Prop* 133,452 122,682 Businessland, Inc.* 373,540 334,839 C&S/Sovran Corp* 1,781,693 1,105,300 C.R.

VSeven of the nation's biggest military contractors are competing for a share of the largest aircraft project on the horizon: A new jet fighter for the Air Force at a cost of up to $50 billion. The seven companies filed ''technical proposals'' with the Government on Tuesday - each one a 3,000-page compendium explaining how it would design a replacement for the F-15, the Air Force's current medium-range fighter. The proposed plane is now called the Advanced Tactical Fighter, or A.T.F. Already each of the companies has spent millions of dollars of its own money in jockeying for a role in the project. 'Program for the 1990's ''It is a must-win program,'' said Herbert F. Rogers, a general manager of the General Dynamics Corporation, one of the competitors. The others are McDonnell Douglas, which makes the F-15, Boeing, Grumman, Lockheed, Northrop and Rockwell International.

VAmerican companies, facing stiff competition from abroad and relaxed antitrust regulations at home, are banding together to cooperate in research and development at an unprecedented rate, according to corporate and Government officials. For the first time, the officials add, the cooperation has gone beyond dealing with such industrywide issues as controlling pollution to projects that could result in new products with broad commercial potential. The projects involve some of the country's biggest companies. Burroughs, I.B.M., Texas Instruments and other computer giants are members of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. Boeing, General Dynamics and Grumman are among 14 companies studying ways to develop computer software for military projects. And Hewlett-Packard and ITT are part of a fiber optics group.

VTWO years ago, Navy pilots testing the new F-18 Hornet discovered that the fighter plane could turn more sharply and climb more steeply than the designers had planned. But those tight turns and sharp climbs put too much stress on the aircraft, causing cracks in its twin tails. The cracks were the result of a design flaw that had slipped past McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, which had made the new plane under a joint contract, and past Navy program officers who had overseen the F-18's development and manufacture from the drawing board to final test flights. After a brief dispute, McDonnell Douglas agreed to pay for repairs and design fixes that eventually cost $65 million. ''That was a biggie,'' said Robert C. Little, a corporate vice president and onetime test pilot, with a shake of his head. ''But it was our responsibility.''

aVMilitary contractors around the country, after five years of the biggest peacetime arms buildup in American history, now are girding for austerity, bitter competition and more onerous demands from the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. It is not just that the military budget is level or even shrinking after soaring earlier in the decade. The broad efforts to narrow the Government's budget deficit, combined with growing doubts about the efficiency and conduct of contractors, are also resulting in major changes in the military procurement system. The stress now is on competition. Scrutiny of company practices has increased. And contractors are finding they must absorb more of the cost of developing new technologies. 'A Sustained Freeze' ''This is a watershed, largely to do with the total amount of spending,'' said Joshua M. Epstein, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''I don't think you'll see much growth in defense spending over the next four years; basically it'll be a sustained freeze.''

aVISRAEL and the United States are locked in what could be the biggest air battle ever in the Middle East. Armed with calculators and cost estimates, the Pentagon is quietly trying to shoot down the 300 Lavi advanced fighter jets that Israel is proposing to build. Using some $1 billion in American aid money, Israel is rushing the Lavi off the drawing board, onto the production lines and into the air in hopes that once it is a reality not even the ablest Pentagon cost-cutters will be able to quash Israel's multi-role, state-of-the art fighter-bomber for the 1990's. Israel has taken the lead in this bizarre arms race by virtue of the fact that tomorrow the first two Lavi prototypes will have their official ''rollout'' for public viewing. Test flights should follow by October.

McDonnell triumphed over an alternative proposal to buy a mix of 32 C-17's and 30 C-33's, the military freight version of the Boeing Company's 747 jumbo jet.

aVThe Rockwell International Corporation announced today a hostile $1.5 billion bid for the Reliance Electric Company, topping a $1.4 billion deal that the General Signal Corporation struck with Reliance in late August. Both Reliance and General Signal were taken aback by Rockwell's bid. "It came as a complete surprise," said Stephen Van Oss, a Reliance spokesman, who added that the matter was discussed at a regularly scheduled board meeting today. He said the company would have no formal response until Rockwell began the tender offer on Friday.

VThe deals are not as big, the fees are not as fat and the personalities are not as flamboyant. Still, corporate takeovers are back. With two months to go until the end of the year, 1994 is on track to be the second-biggest year for mergers and acquisitions in history. As of Oct. 31, deals valued at $284.4 billion were announced, according to the Securities Data Company, a Wall Street research firm. That is just shy of the $292.9 billion announced in all of 1989. The record is $335.8 billion in 1988.

aVAfter a month of resistance, the Reliance Electric Company agreed today to be acquired by its hostile suitor, the Rockwell International Corporation, rather than pursue a friendly merger with the General Signal Corporation. Rockwell will pay $1.6 billion in cash, or $31 a share, to Reliance's shareholders in a deal that is sweeter than the $1.5 billion, or $30 a share, that the company offered in late October to break up a merger with General Signal. To terminate that deal, Reliance will pay General Signal a fee of $50 million, as well as $5.2 million to cover expenses.

VWINGATE INNS INTERNATIONAL wanted to hold its first chain-wide conference in a resort big enough to accommodate 305 people for four days, yet small enough to convey a sense of intimacy during meals and receptions. Because the working sessions would deal with financing, risk management and similarly unexciting topics, Wingate also wanted a range of recreational options where guests could unwind. And so it was that the owners and general managers of the 65 Wingate properties -- mid-priced hotels aimed at business travelers -- spent four days last month at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort in Braselton, Ga., 30 minutes from Atlanta. In addition to the skull sessions, there were tournaments on both of the resort's golf courses, plus opportunities to play tennis, jog, indulge at the spa or hike the trails through the resort's 3,100 acres.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation reported yesterday that earnings fell 85 percent in the fourth quarter because of declining military aircraft production and fewer orders for commercial jet fuselages. Northrop Grumman earned $17 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, on sales of $2.5 billion, down from $117 million, or $1.71 a share, on sales of $2.5 billion in the final quarter of 1997. The results were affected by the Boeing Company's decision to reduce production of its 747 passenger jet. Northrop, which builds 747 fuselages, has said it will cut 1,100 jobs in four states to deal with the Boeing cutback. Earnings were also hurt by a slowdown in B-2 bomber production, the company said.

aVThe General Dynamics Corporation, the nation's largest military shipbuilder, stunned the defense industry yesterday by making an unsolicited $1.4 billion offer for the rival Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., in the face of a changing Government policy that has discouraged such consolidations. News of the offer began to leak out late yesterday and was made official by the two companies later in the day. The General Dyanmics bid had already come to Newport News on Feb. 10 in a letter. General Dynamics is offering $38.50 for every Newport News share, a premium of 35.4 percent over its closing price yesterday. It would also assume $600 million in Newport News debt.

California Microwave, which makes equipment for satellite and wireless communications systems, said it expected a net gain of $38 million from the sale. The California Microwave unit expects record sales of about $95 million in 1999. It specializes in airborne reconnaissance and surveillance systems, government ground-based satellite communications systems, and mission-planning systems. California Microwave also said it would change its name to the Adaptive Broadband Corporation. California Microwave's shares were up 93.75 cents, to $10.50.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation, the nation's largest maker of airframes for commercial aircraft, said yesterday that it would take a $125 million fourth-quarter charge and that 1999 annual profits would be about 20 percent below expectations because of the downturn in demand by Asian countries for Boeing 747's. The Los Angeles-based Northrop produces the fuselage for the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, popular with Asian airlines. Last December, as Asian countries saw a dramatic downturn in air traffic as the region's economy weakened, Boeing announced it was cutting 747 production to two airplanes a month, from five a month just two years ago.

VThe assets that the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor, plans to sell are estimated to be worth around $1 billion, according to people close to the company. The sale is aimed at winnowing out noncore businesses and, perhaps, provide some lift to a stock that has fallen more than 30 percent during the last year. Announcement of the asset sales actually came earlier this month, but without a price tag, when the chief executive of Lockheed, Vance D. Coffman, warned that earnings for the next two years would be about half of analysts' expectations. At that time, he said the company, which is based in Bethesda, Md., would consider shedding noncore assets through sales, spinoffs and public offerings.

The pact covers the years 1997 to 2002, with deliveries continuing into early 2004. It follows a 1996 agreement between the Air Force and McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, to build an additional 80 C-17 military transport aircraft by 2004.

aVTwo military contractors, the Northrop Grumman Corporation and the General Dynamics Corporation, reported earnings gains for the second quarter yesterday. Northrop Grumman, which agreed earlier this month to be bought by the Lockheed Martin Corporation for about $8.3 billion, said net income rose 16 percent because of increased demand for its airplane components. Net was $100 million, or $1.72 a share, up from $86 million, or $1.69 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. On average, analysts had expected earnings of only $1.54 a share.

aVIn what is expected to be the final chapter in the dizzyingly rapid consolidation of big American military contractors, the Lockheed Martin Corporation announced yesterday that it was buying the Northrop Grumman Corporation for $8.3 billion. The deal would reinforce Lockheed Martin's position as the largest weapons supplier to the Pentagon, creating a company with annual revenue of about $35 billion and more than 230,000 employees. It has emerged at the top of the industry, trailed by Boeing and Raytheon, after a swift stream of mergers propelled by the end of the cold war and sharp cuts in the military budget. While this process has been encouraged by the Clinton Administration, others have questioned whether too much of the market will be concentrated in a lineup of behemoths providing a broad array of products. $(Page D2.$)

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close four plants and cut 755 jobs. The aerospace and military equipment giant, which is based in Los Angeles, said the move was part of its strategy of streamlining operations to remain competitive. The closings and job cuts will result in a pretax charge of $90 million against earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996. Northrop said it would close plants in Great River, L.I., with 330 employees losing their jobs; Hawthorne, Calif., where 530 people will be laid off, and Stuart, Fla., where 250 jobs will be lost. More jobs could be lost at the company's Perry, Ga., plant, which will be closed in 18 to 24 months, but no decision has been made on the number of workers there who will be offered transfers. The company said it would be adding jobs at plants in Texas, Georgia, Illinois and Pennsylvania, thereby reducing the net job reductions. Northrop employs 46,600 people.

[C1.] OIL SURGES AFTER MISSILE TESTS -- Oil prices closed at a record high in New York as political tensions over the missile tests by North Korea shook equity and commodities markets around the world. In an already rattled oil market, North Korea's test of at least seven missiles, including one with long-range capability, gave traders another reason to push prices past $75 a barrel. [C1.] WHEN LARGE IS SMALL -- The Small Business Administration and other federal agencies are mandated by law to provide at least 23 percent of federal contracts to small businesses. But for years, government studies show, large corporations like GTSI, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have been counted as small businesses. And despite some efforts by the federal government to correct the mistakes, problems persist.

aVA unanimous Supreme Court on Monday ruled that federal bankruptcy law shields individual retirement accounts from creditors. The decision gives middle-income consumers, for whom an I.R.A. is often the most significant retirement asset, the same protection in bankruptcy that higher-paid workers receive for their 401(k) plans and company pensions. Those company plans, as well as Social Security payments, were already exempt from creditors. But the federal bankruptcy code's treatment of I.R.A.'s was ambiguous enough to have resulted in much uncertainty and conflicting lower-court decisions. In Monday's opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court overturned a 2003 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis.

VNews Analysis WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 - The Air Force's decision in the Great Engine War this evening was but one more turn, albeit a big one, in the long and convoluted struggle for this lucrative contract and, in fact, extended that competition well into the future. By splitting the production and holding the contract to one year, the Air Force will evidently try to exercise competitive pressures on both the General Electric Company and the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Group, a unit of the United Technologies Corporation, to hold down costs, which has been among the main objectives of Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger. The Secretary of the Air Force, Verne Orr, who made the basic decision that was reviewed by Mr. Weinberger, appeared to have taken after his colleague, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman. Mr. Lehman has successfully played off the Grumman Corporation on one side and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Northrop Corporation on the other to hold costs down on Navy planes. The decision, announced this evening, would have General Electric build 120 engines for the single-engine F-16 fighter, and Pratt & Whitney make 40 engines for the dual-engine F-15 fighter. The contract would be for a fixed price, which was not announced.

VTo demonstrate its sophistication in designing fighter planes before the Air Force selects a prime contractor for its next combat plane, the Grumman Corporation has built a pair of ''Star Wars'' aircraft largely from spare parts. Like so much else about the planes, called X-29's, their design borrows from the past - all the way back to the Wright brothers. Yet it shatters barriers that have limited decades of aeronautical architecture. Indeed, the X-29 is intended to feint and dodge - fight - at supersonic speeds and fly farther and faster for a given engine thrust than any current aircraft. ''This is Star Wars in terms of what we're flying today,'' said Glenn Spacht, the project's deputy director.

VThe push by American industry to produce better goods at lower cost appears to be working its way slowly onto the factory floors of many of the Pentagon's major contractors. Prodded by a new toughness in the Pentagon and Congress against cost overruns and poor quality of military hardware, the major arms contractors are installing new production systems and controls to keep costs down and quality up. In turn, the big primary contractors are putting pressure on their suppliers to shape up. ''These companies had a free license to spend and there was a lot of looseness,'' said Representative Joseph Patrick Addabbo, the Queens Democrat who is head of the House Subcommitee on Defense Procurement. ''Now, most contractors realize that the pressure is on to reduce costs. I think they are going to stay with it.''

VEver since the Grumman Corporation agreed to be taken over by the Northrop Corporation in April, employees here knew the merger would lead to layoffs. When the ax finally fell today, it caught few by surprise. But it still hurt their pride. Grumman had once been synonymous with jobs and economic security here. For more than five decades it was Long Island's largest employer, making jet fighters for the Navy and building the Apollo lunar excursion module, which landed astronauts on the moon.

aVIn a response to the nation's shrinking military budget that will strike the economies of Long Island and California, the Northrop Grumman Corporation said today that it would reduce its work force by 8,650 jobs, or more than 18 percent, by the end of 1995. Consultants to military contractors and Wall Street analysts viewed the development as necessary for the newly combined company to survive in a fast-consolidating industry. "This is a healthy response as defense revenues shrink and it is the only way to justify the merger -- to cut costs," Robert Paulson, head of the aerospace practice for McKinsey & Company, a management consultant firm, said. In May, the Grumman Corporation and the Northrop Corporation merged in a $2.1 billion deal. "It shows that management is getting on with the business."

Grumman said last year that it would sell the Glen Arm operation or close it as part of continuing company consolidation. Grumman has since been acquired by the Los Angeles-based Northrop Corporation in a deal valued at $2.17 billion. Workers at the plant made parts for the F-14 Tomcat.

aVCOMAPNIES For Northrop Grumman Workers, the Bad News Gets Very Specific It's no surprise, really. The country is laying down its weapons -- well, except in Haiti -- and that's putting a lot of people out of work. And when Northrop swallowed Grumman earlier this year, everyone knew that spelled more sizable job cuts. But still, when the big shoe dropped last week, the numbers were stark: Northrop Grumman, as it's now known, is reducing its work force by 8,650, or more than 18 percent, by the end of 1995. That's a "healthy response" to Pentagon cutbacks, said one consultant. But don't talk about health on, say, Long Island. In 1986, Grumman gave out 25,000 paychecks there, making it Long Island's largest private employer; those days are already history, of course, but the payroll will soon shrivel even more, to 3,800. The bulk of the latest layoffs, though, will come in California -- 4,150 of them. And that comes just after word that GM Hughes would lay off 4,400.

But the deal could also give companies ambivalent about staying in the business a final push out the door. "It has the possibility of making our strategy of acquisition a little easier," said John Leonis, chief executive of Litton Industries in Los Angeles, of the $10 billion deal that the Lockheed Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation announced on Tuesday. "We think it will encourage companies that get more of their revenues from commercial businesses than from defense to get out, and in some cases these are $1 billion businesses."

VAS Allied commanders prepared to retake Europe, Asia and the Pacific from the Fascist powers five decades ago, the first place they knew they had to win was in the air. The German blitzkrieg, Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Midway all demonstrated that air power, a side show in World War I, was crucial to victory in World War II. Aviation captured the imagination of American generals, inventors, industrialists and the public alike in those dark war years, in a way few industries have, before or since. Aircraft went from being expensive toys to weapons of liberty overnight. Schoolchildren avidly studied recognition silhouettes and knew the names and strengths of dozens of planes. Pioneers of flight like Glenn Curtiss, Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin found themselves at the helm of burgeoning empires. And almost anyone who knew something about planes -- mechanic, stunt pilot, engineer, factory foreman -- could start a company and hope for a Government contract.

The goal is to reduce operating costs by $250 million a year, beginning in 1995, Mr. Kresa said. He did not specify how many layoffs were planned, on top of the 4,500 layoffs Grumman and Northrop already planned for this year.

aVTHE Grumman Corporation, the venerable Long Island military contractor whose future seemed dim, has suddenly emerged as a highly coveted jewel of the weapons industry. As Pentagon spending shrinks, the industry has consolidated, and there are few companies as big as Grumman left to buy -- or as willing to sell to survive. The Northrop Corporation, a competing weapons maker based in Los Angeles, ignited a bidding war for Grumman last week, making a $2.04 billion offer, or $60 a share, that topped a $1.9 billion bid, or $55 a share, made earlier in the week by the Martin Marietta Corporation.

aVThe Grumman Corporation's board agreed today to begin merger discussions with the Northrop Corporation, which has made a hostile $2.04 billion bid to acquire the Long Island military contractor.

aVSince last Thursday, when the Northrop Corporation lobbed its $60-a-share offer to take over the Grumman Corporation alongside an earlier $55-a-share bid from the Martin Marietta Corporation, speculators and analysts have contended that Northrop itself is vulnerable to a takeover. The eagerness of stock traders to bet on that bit of wisdom was starkly visible yesterday, as the price of Northrop's shares soared by $1.875, to $43.75, a new 52-week high, on the flimsiest of circumstances.

aVSeeking to avoid a protracted and potentially costly bidding contest, the Grumman Corporation set auction rules yesterday governing the sale of the company, and set a Thursday deadline for final offers from its two suitors, the Martin Marietta Corporation and the Northrop Corporation.

The letter said that Grumman's board had decided a free and open competitive bidding process was in the best interests of shareholders, customers and suppliers.

aVA day after the Northrop Corporation lobbed a $2.04 billion, $60-a-share hostile takeover bid for the Grumman Corporation, the buzz up and down Wall Street was that no midsized military contractor should consider itself safe -- including Northrop itself. "It's either eat or be eaten," said Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, the head of his own money management firm, which specializes in arbitrage. "The value of every defense firm now has to be looked at. And if Northrop doesn't pull this off, they are extremely vulnerable to a takeover themselves."

aVBorrowing a page from hard-sell television merchandising, Kent Kresa, chief executive of the Northrop Corporation, offered a $70 million premium for the Grumman Corporation today, but only if it agreed to a merger offer within 24 hours.

Eastern time Thursday, Northrop, a weapons company based here, would pay a lesser price for Grumman, which agreed earlier this month in secret negotiations to merge with the Martin Marietta Corporation.

aVIn what appeared to set off a bidding war, the Northrop Corporation offered late yesterday to purchase the Grumman Corporation, the Long Island warplane manufacturer, for $60 a share, or $2.04 billion. The Northrop offer came three days after the Martin Marietta Corporation announced that it would purchase Grumman for $55 a share. The battle for Grumman underscores two aspects of weapons making in the post-cold war era. One is that Pentagon spending for weapons and research, projected at $88 billion this year, is still a very good business for the half-dozen or so manufacturers that survive as major military contractors. The other is that no matter which company -- Northrop or Martin Marietta -- wins Grumman, the new, merged concern will close plants and cut staff.
p822
aVAs the Grumman Corporation discussed merging with the Martin Marietta Corporation for $55 a share last month, the Northrop Corporation, a rival weapons contractor based here, made its own bid of $50 a share, according to documents filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Grumman agreed on Monday to be acquired by Martin Marietta for $55 a share, or $1.9 billion. The S.E.C. filing suggests that the Northrop bid had set up a bidding war that Martin Marietta sought to avoid by paying cash rather than stock for the military contractor based in Bethpage, L.I.

Because the $57 billion program is the largest military program ever to be terminated by the Pentagon, the decision also makes the companies the clearest victims yet within the arms-building business of Federal budget pressures and the continuing decline in the size of the nation's military force.

aVFor the past several decades, the Pentagon and the military contracting industry have spent billions of dollars developing sophisticated electronics capabilities, betting that advanced technology would give the United States a decisive advantage in any war. In the skies over Iraq and Kuwait last week, their strategy was put to its first real test, and the preliminary results seem to be good news for the military and its weapons suppliers. Although claims of military successes were difficult to verify, Pentagon officials said that Tomahawk cruise missiles equipped with complex guidance equipment rocketed into Iraq, identified pre-programmed targets and apparently scored a series of precise hits. Air Force F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft packed with "black box" technology like radar-sensing and jamming gear sped in to destroy radar installations at surface-to-air missile sites. F-15E strike-fighters, equipped with a new system called Lantirn that allows pilots to identify and track targets at night, kept the skies clear of those Iraqi combat aircraft that ventured forth. Officials described how a "smart" bomb dropped from a radar-evading F-117A Stealth fighter-bomber was guided literally through the front door of a missile warehouse. When threatened by an incoming Iraqi Scud missile, American forces in Saudi Arabia shot it out of the night sky with the new and stunningly sophisticated Patriot antimissile system.

Honeywell will pay $220 million in 2001, with the balance due in July 2002, Northrop Grumman said yesterday. Honeywell, which is based in Morris Township, N.J., also announced that it had agreed to transfer its global interests in Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems to Knorr-Bremse A.G. The company expects to take an unspecified gain related to the deal in the first quarter of next year, a Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said. And Honeywell reaffirmed its estimate that fourth-quarter earnings would range from 54 cents to 56 cents, excluding one-time charges.

VNewport News Shipbuilding Inc., the target of a takeover battle between the General Dynamics Corporation and the Northrop Grumman Corporation, said yesterday that it would begin talks with Northrop Grumman. Newport News said it remained committed to its existing agreement to be acquired by General Dynamics but said the bid from Northrop Grumman might now be superior because of a recent rally in Northrop's stock price. Both companies bid $2.1 billion, or $67.50 a share, for Newport News, which designs and builds nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines. General Dynamics' bid was all cash and Northrop's bid included a combination of cash and stock. Newport News said yesterday that Northrop's bid now appeared to be worth $72.67 a share, prompting it to agree to the talks. (Bloomberg News)

aVThe General Dynamics Corporation, vying with the Northrop Grumman Corporation to buy Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., said yesterday that it had extended its tender offer for Newport's shares. General Dynamics said more than 12.7 million shares had been tendered as of Oct. 19, fewer than the 14.9 million shares it said had been tendered as of Oct. 5, a sign that some shareholders had withdrawn their backing. The General Dynamics offer, scheduled to expire last Friday was extended to this Friday. The Pentagon said on Friday it was still reviewing the matter.

aVIn the heyday of the new economy, the Raytheon Company's military plant in the Southern California industrial town of Goleta was easy to ignore. Corporate mergers and cuts in military spending sliced the work force in half. There was little to keep employees loyal when Internet executives from nearby Santa Barbara came calling. ''Some of our brethren have gone to the dot-coms,'' said John Bowen, a senior manager at Raytheon's Infrared Operations, which makes the technology for, among other things, night-vision goggles.

VThe Northrop Grumman Corporation has set the exchange ratio for its $2.6 billion acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding. Newport stockholders who want to be paid only in Northrop common stock will get 0.7193 share for each Newport share. Newport News shareholders will receive $67.50 a share for their holdings no matter how they choose to be paid, Northrop has said. Northrop has about $633.4 million available for Newport News shareholders who receive cash and stock. Northrop will recalculate the exchange ratio if its tender offer is extended beyond tomorrow's deadline. Northrop, which is based in Los Angeles, agreed this month to buy Newport News and create the largest military shipbuilder.

aVNewport News Shipbuilding Inc., the nation's only builder of nuclear aircraft carriers, became part of the Northrop Grumman Corporation yesterday. Northrop, the military conglomerate based in Los Angeles, took possession of Newport, its third shipyard, a little more than three weeks after the Newport board agreed to the $2.1 billion takeover. Northrop also owns the Avondale and Ingalls shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi and is now the world's largest naval shipbuilder, Kent Kresa, Northrop's chief executive, said. The company is also the nation's third-largest military contractor, he said, with nearly 100,000 employees and expected 2002 revenues of $18 billion.

aVTHE news on the job front has not been good. Employers have cut hundreds of thousands of positions this year in response to the weakening economy, especially after Sept. 11, and there are more reports of corporate retrenchment almost every day. The unemployment rate has risen to 5.4 percent, near a five-year high, and is poised to grow. But that does not mean jobs are impossible to find; you just have to know where to look. Several industries seem immune to the current economic downturn, including health care and pharmaceuticals, education, mortgage banking and security. Many employers in those sectors are regularly adding to their work force, economists say.
