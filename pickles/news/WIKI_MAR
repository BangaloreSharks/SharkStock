NaVSPONSORED information services for hotel guests, once as drowsy as a tired traveler, are getting a loud wake-up call in the form of interactive technology. But advertisers are proceeding cautiously as some big new entrants to the field are already deciding to, well, check out. The industry was long characterized by small, entrepreneurial companies producing programs on videotape loops or laser disks for the closed-circuit television systems of hotels and resorts. The services were prototypically passive: guests need only turn on the set -- often pretuned to the channels carrying them -- and watch.

While investors said they planned to appeal, the ruling by Federal District Judge Alexander Harvey 2d may end a three-year fight. The investors, led by PPM America Inc., accused Marriott of committing securities fraud by selling bonds in 1992 and failing to warn them of plans to split into two concerns. The company was divided into Marriott International Inc., a fast-growing hotel-management company, and Host Marriott, a debt-laden real estate concern. Marriott's bonds fell as much as 30 percent after the plan was announced, causing bondholders to sue.

aVLOST IN AMERICA -- In some cities, getting lost is a cinch. About two-thirds of business travelers who rent cars say they expect to get lost while driving in certain cities, according to a survey commissioned by Avis Rent a Car and Motorola, which makes software for Avis Assist, a navigation system that provides driving directions on cellphones. The 10 urban areas most difficult to navigate, according to the study by Bert Sperling, the author of BestPlaces guides in print and online: Boston; Washington; San Francisco; Baltimore; New York-Northern New Jersey; Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood-Pompano Beach, Fla.; Los Angeles; Seattle-Everett, Wash.; Providence, R.I.-Pawtucket, Mass.; and Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach, Va. FRILLS ADDED -- Discount airlines used to brag about their no-frills service, while major airlines countered that business travelers wanted more than a cheap, uncomfortable seat. But some discount carriers -- which have been adding long-haul domestic flights on routes that were once the exclusive province of the majors -- are starting to stress premium-class service. ATA Airlines said it would begin offering discounted business-class service in late November after reconfiguring its fleet of Boeing 737's and 757's, installing a business-class section with 12 seats each. AirTran Airways has been promoting $35 space-available upgrades to business class, which provides 15 percent of its revenue. Last month, AirTran said it had placed 50 orders for Boeing 737-700's and 737-800's as it geared up to battle for market share on longer-haul routes.

This is true in part, he said, because overall United States hotel occupancy rates are expected to decline this year to 63 percent, down from a peak of 65 percent in 1996. ''Typically, hotels fill rooms from least to most expensive, which means a lot of the empty rooms that will be available will be the special rooms,'' he said.

aVWITH the average daily hotel rate increasing by more than 6 percent last year, to $71.73, after almost a 5 percent jump in 1995, travelers continue to find life on the open road ever more costly. But if they can complain about prices, they cannot complain about lack of variety. Between 1980 and 1966, according to a new Coopers & Lybrand analysis, 113 new chains were introduced in the lodging industry -- 10 in just the last 12 months. While many have since failed, the forecast is for even more hotel brands. Last month in Newport Beach, Va., Marriott International opened its first Towne Place Suites, an extended-stay property that charges less than $65 a night. La Quinta Inns opened its first midpriced suites property in Addison, Tex., eight months ago and already has 11 more up and running and is set to have a total of 36 by the end of the year.

VALTHOUGH the Ritz-Carlton name was stripped last weekend from hotels in New York, Washington, Houston and Aspen, Colo., as of yesterday afternoon only the Aspen property appeared resigned to its fate. Its operator answered the telephone: ''Good afternoon, this is Kathy. How may I assist you?'' and when asked if this was the number for the Ritz-Carlton, replied, ''Formerly.'' But operators at the other three properties all answered, ''Thank you for calling the Ritz-Carlton,'' followed by the name of the city. A Ritz-Carlton spokeswoman said that while the hotels no longer had the right to the luxury chain's name, lawyers were still wrangling over it. The issue erupted in the early hours of Saturday when Ritz-Carlton, which is controlled by Marriott International, sent teams of managers into the four hotels to terminate its management agreements with them. The four properties are owned by separate holding companies controlled by an investment firm owned by Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman. The Ritz-Carlton said it had acted because of breaches of contract, including their owners' representatives' refusal to pay more than $4 million in management fees and cost reimbursements.

And two Harvard classmates, Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore, started the Sheraton chain by pooling their World War I veterans' bonuses to invest in real estate. So much for humble beginnings. Today, after more than two decades in which the main action in the hotel industry revolved around conglomerates, investment banks and big property developers, the hotel moguls are back. But this time, they need more than just a dollar and a dream; they need financial acumen, deep-pocketed backers and, if they can swing it, control of a real estate investment trust -- better yet, a paired-share real estate investment trust.

FEWER EUROPEANS COMING -- European air passenger traffic to the United States was off more than 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, says Donald N. Martin & Company, citing Commerce Department data. No reasons were suggested for the downturn, after increases of 6.5 percent and 12.1 percent in 2005 and 2004, respectively. One possible benefit, the forecaster says, is that ''more seats may be available for Americans bound for Europe'' this summer, though trans-Atlantic fares are projected to remain high. U.S. SHARE OF WORLD TRAVEL OFF -- In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association last week J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman of Marriott International, noted that while the global travel industry has grown about 30 percent in the last decade, the United States' share of world travel has shrunk by as much as 9 percent. A major reason is that security procedures for obtaining visas abroad are increasingly tangled. The average wait in Brazil for an interview to obtain a visa to visit the United States is 55 days, he said. In 2000, about 737,000 Brazilians traveled to the United States. Last year, only 485,000 came, he said. MAXJET GROWS -- MaxJet, the discount all-business-class start-up that flies between Stansted Airport serving London and New York and Washington, acquired its third 767 aircraft. In May, the carrier reported a load factor -- the average number of seats occupied by paying customers -- of 72 percent on the New York-London route. Gary Rogliano, the chief executive, said MaxJet planned to acquire a fourth 767 and to announce a new domestic city flying to Stansted later this year. He declined to identify the city. ET CETERA -- Marriott Hotels and Renaissance Hotels are rolling out lobby computer stations to allow guests to check in for flights and print out their boarding passes.

aVTHE airport event of the coming year will be the opening of Hong Kong's huge Chek Lap Kok terminal in April -- a date picked long before the city's current tourist slump and chicken flu crisis. The airport, which occupies reclaimed land near the rugged peaks of Lantau Island, is as large as all of Kowloon, one of Hong Kong's three main districts. Flying in and out of Chek Lap Kok will not be half the fun of making the 21-mile trip from the airport. The city that long ago went vertical with Asia's biggest collection of skyscrapers has now gone horizontal with a scenic superhighway, laced with a lovely suspension bridge, that provides harbor visuals easily as striking as those seen from San Francisco's bridges. It will be an expensive 45-minute trip by taxi or limousine (about $50) or 23 minutes by train ($10 to $12) -- after service begins in June -- rather than the 15-minute commute through the packed streets of Kowloon where the old Kai Tak Airport sits in a tight little space.

Passengers on both carriers will receive boarding passes and seat assignments at their originating city and their bags will be checked straight through. The growth of such partnerships was underscored when Delta Air Lines sponsored a meeting in New York last week for its current and pending partners -- 21 of them, representing carriers from Austria to Brazil to China.

aVBY now, it is the stuff of legend: in the 1980's, Robert L. Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, came up with the idea of removing just one olive from every dinner salad served to passengers. They would never notice, let alone squawk, he figured, and the airline could save some money. He was right, to the tune of $40,000 a year. For much of the 1990's, while the bull ran free on Wall Street and corporate tills brimmed with cash, those kinds of small-but-they-add-up cost considerations were few and far between in corporate America. Then the dot-coms began imploding, many of them disappearing and many others metamorphosing from perk-filled playgrounds to bare-bones bastions. And now, as the larger economy has turned from boom to blah, the spirit of Crandall's Olive is stalking most corporate and Wall Street halls.

The loss of $116 million, or 48 cents a share, is in contrast to net income of $149 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Marriott, which is based in Bethesda, Md., said its revenue fell 10 percent, to $2.87 billion. Marriott took $85 million in write-downs of off-balance-sheet loans it guaranteed or made to developers. Arne Sorenson, the chief financial officer, said that no more write-downs were expected. The company had $1.15 billion in off-balance-sheet items representing loans and guarantees to hotel developers as of the end of the year. The company's revenue per available room, a measure of average occupancy and room rate, fell 25 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, compared with the company's estimate of a decline of as much as 35 percent.

BUSINESS JETS BACK AT REAGAN -- Corporate jet service is returning to Reagan Washington National Airport today after being banned since the 2001 terrorist attacks because of the airport's proximity to the White House and the Capitol. Two private jets are scheduled to land today at the airport, which has been allocated 48 slots daily for arrivals and departures. ''We finally got all the pieces in place,'' said Dan Kidder, a spokesman for the National Air Transport Association. That trade group's president, James K. Coyne, is scheduled to be among the passengers on the inaugural flight, a charter operated by New World Jet from the terminal operated by Jet Aviation at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Teterboro is one of 12 airports approved by federal authorities for originating private flights to Reagan, which handled an average of 122 charter and private flights daily before the terrorist attacks. The new security requirements for Reagan service include a rule that a law enforcement officer be on board each flight. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE -- Plan ahead for possible influenza outbreaks, just in case, the National Business Travel Association says. The association, the trade group for corporate travel managers, said yesterday that it was working with Dr. R.

Dr. Sack, the director of travel medicine services for Johns Hopkins University, will record a seminar on avian flu that will be available to members of the group on its Web site, www.nbta.org. ''Travel managers have a unique role as the key source of travel-related information for their companies and for business travelers,'' said Suzanne Fletcher, the trade group's president. BUSINESS-CLASS FARES CUT -- If you book at least seven days in advance, flying business class to London on British Airways just got cheaper -- about 20 percent less expensive than walk-up prices -- on some trans-Atlantic routes.
